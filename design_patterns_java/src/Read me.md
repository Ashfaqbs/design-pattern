Design patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems. In Java, they are categorized broadly into three main types: 

1. **Creational Design Patterns**  
   Focus: Object creation mechanisms to create objects in a way that is suitable for the situation.  
   - Help make the system independent of how objects are created, composed, and represented.  
   - Key idea: **Control object creation to ensure flexibility and reuse.**

   **Examples:**  
   - Singleton  
   - Factory Method  
   - Abstract Factory  
   - Builder  
   - Prototype  

2. **Structural Design Patterns**  
   Focus: Class and object composition to form larger structures.  
   - Help ensure that different parts of a system work together in a flexible and efficient way.  
   - Key idea: **Simplify relationships between objects or combine them for new functionality.**

   **Examples:**  
   - Adapter  
   - Bridge  
   - Composite  
   - Decorator  
   - Facade  
   - Flyweight  
   - Proxy  

3. **Behavioral Design Patterns**  
   Focus: Interaction and communication between objects.  
   - Help define how objects interact, how responsibilities are distributed, and how workflows are controlled.  
   - Key idea: **Streamline complex communication between objects.**

   **Examples:**  
   - Chain of Responsibility  
   - Command  
   - Interpreter  
   - Iterator  
   - Mediator  
   - Memento  
   - Observer  
   - State  
   - Strategy  
   - Template Method  
   - Visitor  

### Quick Analogy for Understanding Types  
1. **Creational Patterns:** Think of building a house. You decide how to construct it: blueprint (Prototype), modular pieces (Builder), or hiring a factory (Factory Method).  
2. **Structural Patterns:** Consider how you connect rooms: walls (Adapter), open spaces (Bridge), or fancy decorations (Decorator).  
3. **Behavioral Patterns:** Itâ€™s about how people in the house interact: assigning tasks (Command), following workflows (Template Method), or broadcasting news (Observer).
